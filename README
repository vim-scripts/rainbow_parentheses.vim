Rainbow colors for parentheses, based on rainbow_parenthsis.vim of which there are multiple versions by Martin Krischik, John Gilmore, Luc Hermitte, and Steve Losh.

This version uses significantly less code than the older ones (~80% less) and has new options to make it easier to change the colors and the parentheses depth.

Usage:
Run :RainbowParenthesesToggle to toggle it on/off.

Highlight different bracket types:
    :RainbowParenthesesLoadRound " for ( ), default when toggling
    :RainbowParenthesesLoadSquare " for [ ]
    :RainbowParenthesesLoadBraces " for { }
    :RainbowParenthesesLoadChevrons " for < >

Note: may not work for some languages (when syntax's already enabled) because of the limitation the `:syntax region` command.
