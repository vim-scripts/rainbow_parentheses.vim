Rainbow colors for parentheses, based on rainbow_parenthsis.vim of which there are multiple versions by Martin Krischik, John Gilmore, Luc Hermitte, and Steve Losh.

This version uses significantly less code than the other older ones (~80% less) and has new options to make it easier to change the colors and the parentheses depth.

Why make a new version?
Since I wanted to try this feature (rainbow highlighting of parentheses, sounded neat) but looking into the existing code I found that it's very inefficient. So I did a quick rewrite: shortened it, combined what I liked in each version, and added a few things. This was the result.

Usage:
Run :RainbowParenthesesToggle to toggle it on/off.

Highlight different bracket types:
    :RainbowParenthesesLoadRound " for ( ), default when toggling
    :RainbowParenthesesLoadSquare " for [ ]
    :RainbowParenthesesLoadBraces " for { }
    :RainbowParenthesesLoadChevrons " for < >

There are 2 option variables: `g:rbpt_colorpairs` to define a custom color set, and `g:rbpt_max` to change the max parentheses depth to highlight.
